# Title: Guess The Number

### Activity:
- You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.

### Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.

### Extensions:
- Let the user choose the maximum value (so they can play a long game with a random value between 0 and 10000, for example).
- Give feedback to the user: "Wrong, guess higher!" or "Wrong, guess lower!"
